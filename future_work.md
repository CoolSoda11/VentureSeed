# Future Work
1. **Design differentiated learning paths based on user skill levels:**
Offer beginner-friendly resources like templates and walkthroughs, while providing advanced users with optional challenge tasks to sustain engagement and deepen learning.

2. **Strengthen AI prompt integration at key interaction points:**
Embed smart AI prompts during tasks (e.g., "Would you like AI help?" while drafting a business model) to encourage usage without overwhelming users.

3. **Implement auto-grading to validate self-assessments:**
Use backend logic to assess user outputs (e.g., risk accuracy, structure quality) and compare with self-reported scores to ensure training effectiveness and accountability.
