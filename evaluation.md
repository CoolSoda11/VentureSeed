# Evaluation

## Evaluation Plan
VentureSeed is designed with ethical considerations. Bias and fairness are addressed by using diverse training datasets to ensure simulations reflect real-world variability, avoiding stereotypes in virtual character interactions (e.g., investors/customers). Privacy and transparency are prioritized, since user data is anonymized, and the tool clearly explains how decisions impact outcomes (e.g., why a negotiation succeeded/failed). To prevent overreliance on AI, the system emphasizes human agency—users receive feedback but retain control over choices. Plagiarism risks are minimized by focusing on skill application (e.g., negotiation tactics) rather than content generation.
