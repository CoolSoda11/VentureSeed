- **Simulator, Scaffolding, and Guide:** AI helps learners apply theoretical knowledge to real-world settings by providing a simulated environment, structured guidance, and reminders about potential risks, enhancing practical understanding and decision-making.  
- **Contextualized Resource Recommendations:** The tool uses AI to comprehensively search and recommend case studies and professional knowledge tailored to the learner's industry, saving time and improving resource accessibility.  
- **AI Expert Agent:** An AI agent acts as an entrepreneurship expert, offering professional suggestions, polishing ideas, and providing objective decision-making support to mitigate early-stage startup uncertainties.  
- **Structured User Flow with Analysis Report:** AI creates a scaffolding-like user flow, analyzing the entrepreneurâ€™s mindset and ideas through Q&A interactions, culminating in a detailed report to evaluate and refine their business concept.
